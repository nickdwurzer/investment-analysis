# investment-analysis
This repo is for everything related to comparing and analyzing stocks and stock data.  It is intended for educational purposes only.

Currently this project aims to experiment and see what financial data can be gathered and analysed using open-source code.

The end goal is store much of this data in a local database and produce some analysis on the data which could be displayed locally or on the web (undecided which yet).

y_fin1.py uses the python libraries <a href="http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/"> yahoo_fin</a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/"> pandas</a>.  Further exploration will use the python library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/"> yfinance</a>.

Currently y_fin1.py has functions which can:
  
<i>-Print all tickers which can be gathered through yahoo_fin library

-Print the financial statements available from <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/">yahoofinance</a> for a list of tickers.</i>
